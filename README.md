# Game of Life

This is the actually the coolest project ever.
What could possibly be more fun or cool than creating your own ecosystem?


Imagine having a procedurely generated world where critters can evolve and interact with each other?
Since the physics of that world would be different from our own, it's bound to evolve creatures we have never imagined before!


This project was inspired by this video:

Things to build:
- Seed based biome generator (Think minecraft biomes)
- Build Agents that can view the world
- Use a genetic algorithm technique to propograte traits across generations
- Give agents the ability to interact with each other
- Give agents the ability to procreate
- Give a variable reward function for evolution to evolve for


Some ideas on traits an agent can have:
Note that all of these traits will come with a cost. Some will be more significant than others.
- # of eyes
- position of eyes
- number of teeth
- reach
- weight
- speed on land
- type of diet/consumption
- claws / teeth
- sprinting ability
- flight
- speed in air
- ability to swim
- speed in water
- defenses (shell)
- birthing rate
- crossover technique


Biome Types:
- desert
- water
- mountain
- forest
- air
- grassland


Interaction Types:
- Mate
- Fight
- Walk
- Fly
- Swim


Once this is all said and done, we will have a little ecosystem we can spin up whenever we get bored!
We can share the code, and let people experiment with their own little ecosystems.
